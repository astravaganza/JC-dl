# JC-dl
Simple Content downloader for Indian OTT JioCinema (https://www.jiocinema.com/).

*(Currently only supports movies, I haven't looked at TV shows, so if someone wants to open a PR, feel free)*

## Archived
Project archived due to the death of JioCinema.

## Purpose
JioCinema offers many rare and old HQ streams of Indian content which is unfortunately hidden behind DRM and cannot be easily saved for archival purposes. This tool bypasses the DRM restrictions and grabs the **Non-DRM** streams (which are ironically sometimes superior to their DRM counterparts) from JioCinema which can be downloaded directly.

### Prerequisites
An account on JioCinema and the most basic skills.

### WARNING
This tool shall not be abused for purposes which are not archival or educational. Use at your own risk.

## Usage
* Install python and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your shell
* Download yt-dlp (from https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), aria2c (from https://aria2.github.io/) and the ffmpeg suite (from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
(required for [FixupM3u8] task (see https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/e04b003e6469db220131812b4894ac2a1d5ee083/yt_dlp/postprocessor/ffmpeg.py#L872))) and place the binaries in the root directory
* Login with your Mobile Number and OTP (on first run) as prompted
* run `python main.py`
* VideoID can be obtained from the Movie URL (for example: in https://www.jiocinema.com/movies/jaya-ganga?type=0&id=74f26cb06e0111ecb736133f7a349447, `74f26cb06e0111ecb736133f7a349447` is the VideoID). 
* Let yt-dlp and aria2c download the stream (defaults to the most superior stream) and check the `out` folder for the downloaded movie.

## The Workaround
Apparently JioCinema hosts their unprotected content on their `jiobeats` CDN, which was apparently also used for JioMusic (??? See https://github.com/vikas5914/JioMusic-API#listen-song). 
Makes no sense for them to have this open but this workaround has been out for quite some time.

## P. S
I'm really terrible at coding so consider this as the worst code. Please feel free to open PRs.

## Thanks
to yt-dlp for basically solving the m3u8 parsing cause I can't write a parser.

### To-Do
* Add subtitle support
* ~~Simplify the config process~~
* Add logging
* Add custom quality support
